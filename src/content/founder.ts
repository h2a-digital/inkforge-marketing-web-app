    'InkForge started from a simple need: people had strong tattoo ideas but no fast way to explore polished concepts before talking with an artist.',
    'We designed the app around a practical flow: describe your idea, generate custom visuals, test placement with Try On, and keep everything organized.',
    'The goal is clarity and confidence before ink: better references, faster decisions, and cleaner collaboration with your artist.',
